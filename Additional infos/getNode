 Given a pointer to the head of a linked list and a specific position, determine the data value at that position.
 Count backwards from the tail node.
 The tail is at postion 0, its parent is at 1 and so on.

Example
In the first case, there is one element in linked list with a value of 1. The last (only) element contains 1.

In the second case, the list is . The element with position of 2 from tail contains 3.




int getNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* llist, int positionFromTail) {
    SinglyLinkedListNode * head = llist;
    SinglyLinkedListNode * tail = llist;
    int count=0;
    while(tail!=NULL){
        count++;
        tail=tail->next;
    }
    int pos=count-positionFromTail;
    for(int i=1;i<pos;i++){
        head=head->next;
    }
    int value=head->data;
    return value;
}
